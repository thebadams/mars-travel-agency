# Installation

Please clone/fork this repository to get the full functionality.

This project was created using 'node.js' Make sure to have node.js installed before moving forward.

To learn how to install Node, [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

Next you will need to install the packages. To do so type in the following commands into your terminal.

```bash
npm install
```
Running this command will download the necessary dependancies for the application to run. Make sure to run this in the 'client, and the 'server' folders.

If running locally, make sure to use the 'server' folder to set up the database, as well as running the command

```bash
npm run seed
```

This will seed your database with a starter environment to work from.

In the server folder, open your terminal and run the following command to start the server.

```bash
npm run start
```

You can also run the same command in the client folder to run the development server.

# Concept

For this application we wanted to think out side of the box as well as have it be useful. We eventually landed on making a travel agency to Mars. This was because of recent news of billionares using their money to travel to space. 

With commercial space travel on the horizon, it seemed like a fun idea to mock up a one stop portal to get information on weather, potential launch stations, and to book said info into a ticket.
